## Todo

* Add stderr bash conventions and error checking
* Git project settings
* Automation - find symlinks to self and act on raw data. eg monthly reporting.
* Prep for .ofx import - Cat individual account files and remove duplicate headers if present
* Documentation - How to use
* Substitution widget, append to command list.
* Add feature to pull all sed commands from files
*"Scripts that assume /bin/sh supports extensions like this will break on OSes like recent Debian and Ubuntu releases where that's not the case" This a problem?
