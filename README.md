# csv-cleaner
Simple cli (command line interface) open source .csv (comma separated values) cleaner. I use it for preparing .csv files for conversion to .ofx files for import to financial software like Quicken, Quickbooks, or open source Gnucash (https://gnucash.org). 

Requirements:

* Bash (or equivalent) 
* Sed
* csv2ofx (optional 'pip install csv2ofx' - more here - https://github.com/reubano/csv2ofx)

Mapping file(s) are included for csv2ofx, e.g usaa.py.
